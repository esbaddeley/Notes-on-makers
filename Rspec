Rspec

Double
Def - Model of an object that stands in for an object - rather than an instantiation of the object itself.

1. - Used to isolate tests by ensure you're not rely in code from another class to pass the test.

2. Simplifies the set up for a test, particularly where the object relied on is a complex one


Stubs - we care about the return values, we used to plug the holes in the method
Mocks - we simulate behaviour and check that the object receives the right messages.

The error messages will tell us what methods we need to stub on which objects.

Really complex tests indicate that there could be an issue with the design.

In unit tests the only way to be absolutely sure that you're components are working, and it allows for emergent design - so a better design to reveal itself through the development of the testing.

You can stub methods on real objects as well as doubles - but you want to be careful as you might change the behaviour you're trying to test, and make the test invalid.
